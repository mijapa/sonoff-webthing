# sonoff-webthing
Implementation of Mozilla IoT Web Thing

It is possible to program Sonoff RF R2 POWER with NodeMCU.
Connect: 
3V of the NodeMCU to 3V3 of the Sonoff, 
G of the NodeMCU to GND of the Sonoff, 
TX of the NodeMCU to TX of the Sonoff, 
RX of the NodeMCU to RX of the Sonoff, 
EN of the NodeMCU to G (that will disable the ESP8266 on the NodeMCU).
For flashing the Sonoff hold the button while connecting the NodeMCU to usb. 
The LED remains off until the flashing process is done and the board is rebooted.
